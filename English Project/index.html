          The development of technology now, cannot be separated from the
          development of language and culture of each country. The development
          of technology now, cannot be separated from the development of
          language and culture of each country. Because every country has a very
          different culture and customs. Because every country has a very
          different culture and customs. How to bridge between technology and
          culture to stay in sync and relevant, then the answer is that by
          learning English then we can communicate well to people around us who
          are far different cultures and languages.

    <h3>1. Conditional sentences</h3>
    <p>Also known as "if-then" sentences, typically have two clauses: the "if" clause (also called the conditional clause) and the main clause. The structure usually follows this formula: If clause (conditional clause): Begins with "if" and expresses the condition. Main clause: Follows the if-clause and expresses the result or consequence.</p>
    <br>
    <p>There are four main types of conditional sentences:</p>
    <br>
    <p>-	Zero Conditional: Used for general truths and facts. It expresses situations that are always true.</p>
    <pre>
        If + present simple, + present simple
        Example: If you heat ice, it melts.
    </pre>
    <p>-	First Conditional: Used for possible situations in the future. It expresses a real possibility or a future action based on a condition.</p>
    <pre>
      If + present simple, + future simple
      Example: If it rains tomorrow, we will stay indoors.
    </pre>
    <p>-	Second Conditional: Used for hypothetical situations in the present or future. It expresses situations that are unlikely or unreal in the present or future.</p>
    <pre>
      If + past simple, + would/could/might + base form of the verb
      Example: If I won the lottery, I would buy a mansion.
    </pre>
    <p>-	Third Conditional: Used for hypothetical situations in the past. It expresses situations that did not happen in the past.</p>
    <pre>
      If + past perfect, + would/could/might + have + past participle
      Example: If she had studied harder, she might have passed the exam.
    </pre>

    <h3>2.	Relative Pronouns</h3>
    <p>Relative pronouns are used to connect clauses or phrases within a sentence and show the relationship between them. Common relative pronouns include "who," "whom," "whose," "which," and "that." Here's a brief explanation of each:</p>
    <br>
    <p>Who: Refers to people.</p>
    <p>Example: The man who is standing over there is my uncle.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Whom: Also refers to people, often used in formal writing or when the relative pronoun is the object of the verb.</p>
    <p>Example: The woman whom you met yesterday is my boss.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Which: Refers to things or animals.</p>
    <p>Example: The book which is on the table is mine.</p>
    <br>
    <p>That: Can refer to both people and things, and is often used in restrictive clauses (essential information to the sentence).</p>
    <p>Example: The car that I bought last week broke down.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Whose: Indicates possession and can refer to people, animals, or things.</p>
    <p>Example: The girl whose phone rang during the lecture apologized.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Where: Refers to a place.</p>
    <p>Example: This is the house where I grew up.</p>
    <br>
    <p>When: Refers to a specific time.</p>
    <p>Example: That was the day when everything changed.</p>

    <h3>3.	Concordance</h3>
    <p>Concordance or agreement is the adjustment between the subject and the predicate in a sentence. The adjustment between the subject and the predicate in question is that if the subject is singular, then the predicate used must also stay. Vice versa, if the subject is plural then the predicate used is also plural. The characteristic of a single predicate in English is that there is an addition of the suffix s / es in the word. And for plural predicates without any additions.</p>
    <p>
      Examples:
    </p><br>
    <p>
      -	read (plural), reads (singular)<br>
      -	run (plural), runs (singular)<br>
      -	study (plural), studies (singular)<br>
      - play (plural), plays (singular)
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>Example :</p>
      <br>
      <p>
      - Maria <span>was</span> watching music concert by herself yesterday.<br>
      - My mother <span>cooks</span> delicious chicken soup.<br>
      - Rudy and Sarah <span>were</span> celebrating their first marriage anniversary last Sunday.<br>
      - My brother and I always <span>play</span> table tennis every weekend.<br>
      - ither my brother or my sister <span>loves</span> watching action movies.<br>
      - Neither my sister nor my friends <span>like</span> playing Badminton.<br>
    </p>
    
    <h3>4.	Participle</h3>
    <p>Active participle</p>
    <br>
    <p>Active participles are present participles that become adjectives. As an adjective, the active participle can be placed before a noun or after a noun. If there is no "be" before the -ing verb, then the verb is an active participle. Active participles are used to provide additional information in participle clauses. In other words, active participles have the same function as relative pronouns. The sentence structure is not much different if the active participle is placed after the noun. The formula: Base Form Verb + ing 
      <br></br>
      for example "walk" becomes "walking" Example:
      <br>
      1. The runner girl is my cousin.<br>
      2. Moving tree branches give me goosebumps.<br>
      3. The boiling water caused his tongue to burn.<br>
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>Passive Participle</p>
      <br>
      <p>There are 2 (two) forms of Passive Participle :</p>
      <br>
      <p>a. Present Passive Participle</p>
      <pre>   Being + Past Participle.</pre>
      <p>Example sentence:</p>
      <p>The work being done will soon be finished. (Pekerjaan yang sedang dikerjakan ini akan segera selesai)</p>
      <br>
      <p>b. Past Passive Participle</p>
      <pre>   Having been + Past Participle</pre>
      <p>Example sentence:</p>
      <p>Having been asked to help, I couldnâ€™t go home earlier. ((Karena) sudah diminta untuk membantu, aku tidak bisa pulang lebih awal.)</p>
